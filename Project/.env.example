# Voice Assistant API Configuration
REACT_APP_VOICE_API_KEY=your_voice_api_key_here

# Add your voice service API key here
# For example:
# REACT_APP_VOICE_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Note: The current implementation uses Web Speech API which doesn't require an API key
# This is for future integration with services like OpenAI Whisper, Google Speech-to-Text, etc.
